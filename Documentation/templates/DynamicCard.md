# DynamicCard Web Component

## Overview
The `DynamicCard` component is a custom web component built using ZephyrJS, designed to deliver an interactive and dynamic user experience (UX) and user interface (UI). It offers an intuitive interface through the use of custom attributes, and is ideal for modern web applications that require responsive, interactive cards.

## Features

### 1. Dynamic Interaction
- **Flip on Hover**: The card flips when hovered over, revealing additional content on the back.
- **Expandable Mode**: The card expands when clicked or tapped, providing more space for detailed information.
- **Collapsible Sections**: The card can feature collapsible sections, enabling users to control the visibility of content.

### 2. Custom Attributes
- `data-flip="true/false"`: Enables or disables the card flip interaction on hover. (optional)
- `data-expand="true/false"`: Enables or disables the card's expandability. (optional)
- `back-image="URL"`: Specifies the image URL for the card, displayed dynamically within the component. (optional)
- `front-image="URL"`: Specifies the image URL for the card, displayed dynamically within the component. (optional)
- `data-status="active/inactive"`: Reflects the card's current status with an indicator. (optional)
- `flip-on="hover/click/both"`: Allows specification on how the card's flip event should be handled. (optional)

### 3. UX/UI Features
- **Parallax Effect**: Subtle parallax animations adjust based on user interaction (hover/touch).
- **Content-Aware Layout**: The card adjusts its layout to prioritize the optimal presentation of text, images, or other content types.
- **Status Indicator**: A small colored indicator that reflects the card's status (e.g., green for active, red for inactive).

### 4. Simple Usage Example

Here’s an example of how to use the `DynamicCard` component in your HTML:

```html
    <zephyr-card
        data-transition="slide"
        front-image="https://wallpapers.com/images/featured/cute-anime-profile-pictures-k6h3uqxn6ei77kgl.jpg">
    <div slot="front">
        <h2>Title</h2>
        <p>Short summary or description.</p>
    </div>
    <div slot="back">
        <h2>Back Title</h2>
        <p>Back content</p>
    </div>
</zephyr-card>
```

### 5. Additional Features
- **Animation Speed**: Customizable via CSS variables to fine-tune animations.
- **Responsiveness**: Adjusts layout and size based on the device or screen size for seamless mobile performance.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes are included for screen readers, ensuring full accessibility.

## Technical Details

### ZephyrJS Implementation

DynamicCard uses ZephyrJS to encapsulate styles and manage the component's lifecycle through shadow DOM. Key interactions such as click and hover events trigger dynamic transitions to ensure smooth animations.

### Core Methods:
- **connectedCallback**: Initializes the component and sets up event listeners for user interactions.
- **disconnectedCallback**: Cleans up event listeners when the component is removed.
- **setState**: Dynamically manages the component’s state, such as flipped or expanded mode.

## Conclusion
DynamicCard offers a simple, flexible, and dynamic way to create interactive cards with minimal setup. With a few custom attributes, developers can easily control the behavior and appearance of the card, providing a highly customizable experience for users.
